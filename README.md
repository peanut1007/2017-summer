# 2017-summer
summer intern/project 
week 1 - identifying neoplasm patients in mimic3 data, mapping to UMLS CUI. 
week2 - tested NLTK tokenization, comparing it with regular expressions; 
      -read bs4 documents and tried to figure how it works with lxml packages, such as `lxml.html.soupparser`. 
      -We have built python script to parse SNOMEDCT, etc bioportal purl, 
    Q: I couldn't retrieve any relative ICD10CM, ICD10, or ICD9CM for the keyword 'neoplasm'. On the mimic dataset, it seems the icd9_id doesn't match icd9data.com either.
